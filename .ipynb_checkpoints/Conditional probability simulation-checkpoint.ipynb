If the generated number is less than 0.6 we can say that the coach is Sam (because Sam is the coach in 60% of games). Then we generate another random number and if the value is less than 0.5 (the chance of being the goalkeeper when Sam is coaching is 50%), it means you will be the goalkeeper. In that case, we will increase the value of variables SAM_YES and YES by one. It means that in this simulation run you are the goalkeeper and Sam is the coach.
